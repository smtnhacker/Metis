## Usage

Make sure you are in the `src` folder and run the following:

```bash
python main.py
```

The rest of the application should be pretty straightforward (if they are not, please raise an issue or contact me!) 

#### Notes

For a book entry to appear in the list, it must satisfy **all** filter criteria (genre and search field). For a book to satisfy the genre criteria, it must have **at least** one genre that appears in the list.
